// DEV-SETUP: Make a copy of this file, and call it 'config.json'. Then remove all the comments below while following what they say to do!
// - OPTIONAL settings can be left with their current values and the majority of the bot will work just fine
// - REQUIRED settings must be set to a valid value for large parts of the bot to work, or start up in the first place.
// All configs that already have values are designed to work with the container layout that results from using vscode dev containers. If youre developing by a different means then they will likely have to be different.
